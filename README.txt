Sunrise Alarm Clock
by Patrick Miller

In Winter 2014, I was living in a bedroom with a very small window, and it was very dark in the morning. I also wanted to recycle an LED bulb with a broken power supply, so I decided to create an alarm clock that simulated the sunrise.

The completed alarm clock made waking up much more pleasant!
